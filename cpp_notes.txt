int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    
    return 0;
}
In the context of C or C++ programs, argc and argv are parameters passed to the main function, which allow the program to handle command-line arguments.

int argc: Argument count. This represents the number of command-line arguments passed to the program, including the name of the program itself. For example, if the program is run with:

bash
Copy code
./my_program arg1 arg2
Here, argc would be 3 (./my_program, arg1, and arg2).

char **argv: Argument vector. This is an array of C-strings (i.e., char*), where each element is one of the command-line arguments passed to the program. The first element (argv[0]) is the name of the program, and the following elements (argv[1], argv[2], etc.) are the actual arguments passed.

For example, if you run:

bash
Copy code
./my_program hello world
argc will be 3.
argv[0] will be "./my_program".
argv[1] will be "hello".
argv[2] will be "world".

The line of code:

cpp
Copy code
auto node = std::make_shared<rclcpp::Node>("Cpp_test");
is creating a shared pointer to a new ROS 2 node in C++. Here's an illustration of what this line does:

Key Components:
auto:

Automatically deduces the type of the variable node based on the result of std::make_shared<rclcpp::Node>. In this case, it will be std::shared_ptr<rclcpp::Node>, which is a shared pointer to a Node object.
std::make_shared<rclcpp::Node>("Cpp_test"):

This creates a shared pointer to an instance of the rclcpp::Node class. The "Cpp_test" string is passed as an argument to the Node constructor, setting the name of the node to "Cpp_test".
rclcpp::Node:

This is a class in ROS 2 representing a node, which is a process that can communicate with other nodes in a ROS system.
What Happens:
Node Creation: A new instance of the rclcpp::Node class is created, and its name is set to "Cpp_test".
Shared Pointer: The std::make_shared function creates a smart pointer of type std::shared_ptr that manages the lifetime of the Node object. A shared pointer allows multiple parts of the program to share ownership of the object. The Node will be automatically destroyed when no more shared pointers point to it.
Usage: The node can now be used to access methods and functionality of the rclcpp::Node class, such as creating publishers, subscribers, timers, etc.
Illustration:
Imagine that rclcpp::Node is like creating a car:

Car Creation: You're making a new car and giving it a name ("Cpp_test").
Ownership Sharing: The car (node) is managed by multiple drivers (shared pointers), and it will only be destroyed when no driver (shared pointer) owns it anymore.
In summary, this line efficiently creates and manages a ROS 2 node instance with a shared pointer, ensuring proper memory management in a multi-owner environment.

The lines:

cmake
Copy code
add_executable(cpp_node src/my_first_node.cpp)
ament_target_dependencies(cpp_node rclcpp REQUIRED)
are part of a CMakeLists.txt file, commonly used to build a ROS 2 C++ package. Hereâ€™s what each line means:

1. add_executable(cpp_node src/my_first_node.cpp)
add_executable: This CMake command tells the build system to compile the C++ source file src/my_first_node.cpp and create an executable named cpp_node.
cpp_node: This is the name of the output executable. After compilation, you can run this node using this name (e.g., ros2 run your_package cpp_node).
src/my_first_node.cpp: This is the path to the C++ source file you are compiling.
2. ament_target_dependencies(cpp_node rclcpp REQUIRED)
ament_target_dependencies: This CMake macro sets the dependencies for the target (in this case, cpp_node) using the ROS 2 ament build system.
cpp_node: Refers to the executable target that you defined earlier with add_executable.
rclcpp: Specifies that the target (cpp_node) depends on the rclcpp library, which is the core C++ library for ROS 2.
REQUIRED: Ensures that this dependency is mandatory. If the rclcpp library is not found, the build will fail.
Meaning:
Building the node: These lines tell CMake to compile your C++ source file (src/my_first_node.cpp) into an executable (cpp_node).
Linking with ROS 2: The ament_target_dependencies line ensures that your node links to the necessary ROS 2 libraries (in this case, rclcpp) so it can access ROS 2 functionality like creating publishers, subscribers, and nodes.
Full Workflow:
You write a ROS 2 node in src/my_first_node.cpp.
CMake builds this file into an executable called cpp_node.
cpp_node is linked to ROS 2 libraries (like rclcpp), which allow your code to interact with ROS 2 services and topics.
This ensures your code is properly compiled and can interact with the ROS 2 ecosystem.
